**Blog**
Although I have deeply familiar with ruby on rails, during covid-19 break-out I have decided to start learning this framework as deep as I can. Since now, I am going to upgrade myself using this framework and I believe this would be a uniqe chance to highten my knowledge.

**Resource**
To prepare this blog I have used a very useful youtube video which helps me to understand basic stuff in ROR.
